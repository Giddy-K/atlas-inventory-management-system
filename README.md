Project Description

The Atlas Stock and Inventory Management System is a comprehensive solution for tracking and managing stock levels, sales, and supplier details for businesses. Designed to streamline inventory processes, the system ensures efficient stock handling, prevents overstocking or understocking, and provides valuable insights through real-time analytics.

This project was developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering Portfolio Project by our team to demonstrate proficiency in full-stack web development and effective collaboration.
Features

    Stock Management: Add, update, and delete stock items with detailed attributes (e.g., name, SKU, quantity, price).
    Sales Tracking: Record and manage sales transactions.
    Supplier Management: Maintain a database of suppliers for easy reference.
    Inventory Analytics: Generate reports to analyze stock levels and sales trends.
    User Roles: Role-based access for administrators and staff.
    Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used

Frontend:

    HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
    Framework: React.js

Backend:

    Node.js with Express.js

Database:

    MongoDB (NoSQL database)

Version Control:

    Git and GitHub

Deployment:

    Heroku / Render (for web hosting)
    MongoDB Atlas (for database hosting)

System Architecture

The project follows a three-tier architecture:

    Frontend: The user-facing application developed using React.js, which communicates with the backend through REST APIs.
    Backend: A Node.js server with Express.js, which handles requests, processes data, and manages business logic.
    Database: A MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas for storing stock, sales, and supplier data.
